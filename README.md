## Introduction
The Weather application displays the current weather based on the user's input location using the OpenWeather API. It also provides clothing recommendations based on the current weather conditions. (This section can mention that integrating an AI model could provide more specific recommendations tailored to individual users). Users can see the current weather, minimum and maximum temperature, wind speed, humidity, and other basic weather conditions.
